## Walmart Stores Sales Forecasting

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data

This dataset includes historical sales information for 45 establishments spread across several geographies. The aim is to project the sales for each department in each store, each of which has multiple departments.In this dataset we have 3 csv files.Every year, Walmart holds a number of special markdown sales. The Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are the four biggest holidays that these markdowns coincide with. In comparison to non-holiday weeks, the assessment of the weeks that include these holidays is weighted five times more heavily. Modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data is one of the challenges posed by this competition.
